                    <span class="blue"> private, Catholic research university</span> run by the <span class="blue">
                    De La Salle Brothers </span> located in <span class="blue">Taft Avenue,  Malate, Manila</span>,

                    (DLSC) in Nozaleda Street, <span class="blue">Paco, Manila</span> with Br. Blimond 
                    Pierre <span class="blue">FSC</span> serving as first director. The educational institution 
                    moved to its present location in 1921 to facilitate the increase in enrollment. The college 
                    was granted university status on February 19, 1975 and is the oldest constituent of 
                    <span class="blue">De La Salle Philippines</span> (DLSP), a network of 16 Lasallian institutions 
                    established in 2006 to replace the <span class="blue">De La Salle University System</span>.

                    The university started as a <span class="blue">boys'</span> elementary and high school. In 1920 
                    it began offering a two-year <span class="blue"> Associate in Arts</span> Commerce program, which 
                    was later discontinued in 1931 in favor of a Bachelor of Science in Commerce program. DLSU currently
                    offers <span class="blue">coeducational</span> undergraduate and <span class="blue">graduate degree 
                    </span> programs through its seven colleges and one  school specializing in various disciplines, 
                    including business, engineering and liberal arts. Students and alumni from La Salle were previously 
                    referred to as Lasallites, but the term has since been changed to Lasallians.
